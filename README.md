Metadata interface for wordpress
The Semantic web is a project designed to turn the web into a massive database organised by metadata. This will allow people to search across sites for material within particular contexts.
To date there has been little work done on how end-users might navigate and apprehend the Semantic Web.
This project works towards that by starting with a small, consistently organised subset of the web, those sites built using Wordpress.
By familiarising users with the power of metadata as an organising and navigating framework, it will provide a consistent framework for navigating websites using metadata. 
As that evolves it can be applied to more complex sites, such as dbPedia, thereby building toward an interface for the Semantic Web.
